# SQL Learning Journey

## 📌 About this repository
This repository documents my journey learning SQL from scratch.
I write notes in simple language so I can clearly understand
what each query does and when to use it.

This repo is both:
- My personal learning notebook
- A portfolio showing how I think about SQL

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- SELECT
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- DISTINCT
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- GROUP BY
- HAVING

## 🧠 How I Learn SQL
- Each `.sql` file contains:
  - Comments explaining the concept
  - A clear example query
  - Common mistakes I’ve made
- I focus on understanding **why**, not just memorizing syntax
- I document mistakes so I don’t repeat them
